# THE BETTER SOFTWARE COMPANY (THEBETTERSOFTWARECOMPANY.COM)

## Overview and Origin

* The Better Software Company is a company that defines the true definition of FinTech. They run under the motto, providing quality technology and exceptional customer service. In this statement, we see the embodiment of FinTech. The financial part being the customer service, as customers equate to money and value and the technology part equates to the technical aspect of FinTech.

* This company was incorporated on August 28, 2014, in Ottawa, Canada. 

* It was founded by Steve Cody who later took on Bruce Linton as his partner. 

* The Better Software Company began as a means to help out Steve who, back then, had an over hectic work and company running schedule. Steve realized that the software and technology he was using to run his small business was outdated, too complicated, slow and time consuming. So, the Better Software Company was birthed as a means to be an efficient software for Steve’s company. Steve then realized that if he can provide such effective service to his own small business through the technology he had founded, why not monopolize it.

* The earliest funding of the company was mainly through it being listed a s public company. As aforementioned, when Bruce came in, he purchased part of the ownership, thus bringing in some extra funds and also through government issuances of bonds.

## Business Activities

* The specific financial problem that this company tries to solve is in the everyday running of small businesses. The Better Software Company is a Software Developing Company that is designed a system, software and technology aimed at managing multiple spreadsheets, clientele and automated help. The specific financial problem it is trying to solve is to bridge the gap between franchises and different locations which can help the owner manage every movement within the company. It provides an all-round employee surveillance and customer activities.

* It’s intended customers are mostly start-up businesses and franchises and because companies are starting and growing, they have a fair amount of market size. 

* The biggest advantage that this company has over its competitors here in Canada is that it is local, and the majority of its competitors are not Canadian. For example, Suade and Mond are also RegTech Companies, but they are based in America. Also, The Better Software Company has a much more user-friendly and an easier-to-navigate software.

* Some of the technologies they use is a software called Pinpoint Software which is a technology that helps who builds software, to build to better by aggregating the activity data with AI.

## Landscape

* I believe The Better Software Company falls under the financial domain of RegTech, as it manages the regulatory processes within the financial industry.

*RegTech has changed over the years since the 2008 market crash from being a software that could manage fraudulent activates to a software and technology that can now manage and incorporate the safety of running a company through providing employee surveillance, cyber security, financial spreadsheets, and customer activities. I believe that the next ten years, RegTech will be able to identify and eliminate unnecessary business losses and the use of less computer hardware which saves space.

* Some of the major companies in RegTech, are Suade, Mond and Passfort.

## Results

* The Better Software Company has impacted the business world by providing quality technology, thus creating time saving, inexpensive ways for the everyday running of businesses. But it has also negatively affected the employment market as the need for human management has been replace by software. For instance, where a manager could check on past and present customers, The Better Software Company offers a data warehouse. 

* Companies in this domain measure success through providing an efficient way to track, “bottom or funnel conversion rate.” As this metric system allows companies to pay attention and to know which of their leads are closing, thus a happy customer equals success.

* According to their website and because it is a local company in Canada, which is the first one of its kind to implement some of this technology, The Better Software Company is doing fairly well on the market but there is always room for improvement.

## Recommendations

* My recommendation for The Better Software Company is that they would create a cellphone application.

* The reason being, our mobile phones are basically our computers and with the integration of 5-G, it can be more productive for a CEO or a Manager to manage the affairs of an entire company from a mobile device.  

* This service would utilize easy mobility as opposed to sitting at a desk. There is also a significant decrease in the cost between a computer hardware and a mobile phone.
